END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY: This End-User License Agreement for Intergraph Corporation (“EULA”) is a legal agreement by and between “you” (either an individual or a single legal entity) and Intergraph Corporation d/b/a the Security, Government and Infrastructure division of Intergraph (“Intergraph”) for the Intergraph software product(s) (“SOFTWARE PRODUCT”) delivered with this EULA, which includes the computer software, object code copy, and all of the contents of the files, disk(s), CD-ROM(s) or other media with which this EULA is provided, including any templates, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation, all copies, and any modified versions, fixes, patches and Updates of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, if any, licensed to you by Intergraph.  Any software, including, without limitation, any modified versions, fixes, patches and/or Updates provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA, which shall take precedence over any other document and shall govern your use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, unless you have a signed license agreement with Intergraph that specifically addresses the licensing of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, in which case the signed license agreement shall take precedence and shall govern your use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  You agree that this EULA is enforceable against you the same as any written, negotiated contract signed by you.  If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, you are not authorized to, and you shall not, download, install or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
1.0 DEFINITIONS.  As used in this EULA, the following terms are defined as follows and other capitalized terms set forth in this EULA shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this EULA:
        1.1 “Primary License” means the license(s) of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to you for general production use as authorized by this EULA.
        1.2 “READ-ME file” means a computer text file that contains information a User may need to install or operate a SOFTWARE PRODUCT program.
        1.3 “Supplementary License” means a license(s) of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT which is made available by Intergraph for select SOFTWARE PRODUCTS to augment Primary Licenses for special purposes. Each Supplementary License requires a Primary License and the term of the Supplementary License shall not exceed the term of the applicable Primary License.
        1.4 “System” means any collection of your computers sharing a single licensing server or a set of redundant licensing services.
        1.5 “Update” means any Upgrade, modified version, fix, patch and/or update of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
        1.6 “Upgrade” means each new release of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Upgrades require a full installation and may be provided with a separate EULA. The EULA delivered with the Upgrade will supersede any EULA associated with prior releases of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
        1.7 “User” means you or any individual authorized by you to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant to the terms and conditions of this EULA. A User may also include your contractor who requires temporary use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to provide services on your behalf.
        1.8 “XML Files” means the XML (Extensible Markup Language) files generated by the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, where applicable.
        1.9 “XSL Stylesheets” means the XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) presentation of a class of XML Files which, when included with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, describe how an instance of the class is transformed into an XML (Extensible Markup Language) document that uses the formatting vocabulary.
2.0 LICENSE GRANT.  Provided you are not in breach of any term or condition of this EULA, Intergraph hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to install and use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, in object code form only, strictly for your internal use and strictly in accordance with this EULA. The license is non-transferable, except as specifically set forth in this EULA. You assume full responsibility for the selection of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to achieve your intended results, and for the installation, use and results obtained from the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 
        2.1 Minimum Requirements.  The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may require your System to comply with specific minimum software, hardware and/or Internet connection requirements. The specific minimum software, hardware and/or Internet connection requirements vary by SOFTWARE PRODUCT and per type of license and are available from Intergraph upon request.
        2.2 License Type and Mode.  SOFTWARE PRODUCTS are licensed as either Primary Licenses or Supplementary Licenses. There are six (6) types of Supplementary Licenses as described below. Depending on your license, a license may be used in either Concurrent-Use mode or Node-Locked mode. The license type and mode for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT you subscribed to or obtained will be designated (per the abbreviations set forth below) in the product description set forth on the proposal, quote or packaging provided with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and, if an electronic license manager tool is incorporated in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, verified by the Intergraph license system.  If not otherwise indicated, your license type and mode will be a Node-Locked Primary License. Each license of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is subject to the terms of this EULA.
                2.2.1 Concurrent-Use mode (CC) allows for the checking in and checking out of the total available licenses of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for Users.  At any point, you may run as many copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as you have licenses.  If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is enabled to be run in a disconnected mode, as set forth in the READ-ME file, a User may check out a license from the System for mobile or home use, thus reducing the total number of licenses available in the license pool until the license is checked back in to the System.  If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is not enabled to be run in a disconnected mode, the mobile or home computer will require a Node-Locked License.  If the anticipated number of Users of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will exceed the number of applicable licenses, and in the absence of a license manager tool incorporated in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you must use a reasonable mechanism or process to assure that the number of persons using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT concurrently does not exceed the number of licenses.
                2.2.2 Node-Locked mode (NL) allows a single copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to be stored on hard disk and loaded for execution on a single designated workstation, or, for software designed for use on a handheld device, for execution on a single designated handheld device.  
                2.2.3 Supplementary Licenses are described below:
(a) Backup License (BCK) is licensed solely for “cold standby” when manual switchover of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to the Supplementary License is required in the event of failure of the Primary License.
(b) Developer’s License (DEV) is a license of a Web-based SOFTWARE PRODUCT that is delivered solely in connection with the Primary License of such SOFTWARE PRODUCT for the purposes of developing and testing your website built only with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Developer’s Licenses shall not be used for production purposes (i.e. a fully deployed website).
(c) Load Balancing License (LOB) is a license of a Web-based SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for use as a second or successive license on a web cluster to balance the load with the Primary License.
(d) Redundant License (RDT) is licensed solely for “hot standby” when automatic switchover of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to the Supplementary License is required in the event of failure of the Primary License.
(e) Test License (TST) is licensed solely for testing purposes. However, Intergraph also allows a Test License to be used to conduct no-cost training on test servers for a maximum of thirty (30) days per year.
(f) Training License (TRN) is licensed solely for training purposes.
        2.3 Updates.  If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an Update to a previous version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you must possess a valid license to such previous version in order to use the Update. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT and any previous version may not be used by or transferred to a third party.  All Updates are provided to you on a license exchange basis and are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the EULA provided with the latest version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  By using an Update, you (i) agree to voluntarily terminate your right to use any previous version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, except to the extent that the previous version is required to transition to the Update; and (ii) acknowledge and agree that any obligation that Intergraph may have to support the previous version(s) of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will end upon availability of the Update. If an Update is provided, you will take prompt action to install such Update as directed by Intergraph. If you fail to do so, you acknowledge that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not work correctly or that you will not be able to take advantage of all of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT’s available features.  In such event, Intergraph will not be liable for additional costs you incur as a result of your failure to install such Update.

                6.2.2	Indemnification by You.  In the event any proceeding (suit, claim, or action) is based (in whole or in part) on modifications, enhancements or additions made by you or any person or entity on your behalf, or your use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in combination with other products not furnished by Intergraph, you agree to hold harmless and defend, at your sole cost and expense, all of Intergraph’s right, title and interest in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, as well as Intergraph’s goodwill and reputation both in good faith and at a standard as if the claim is made against you. You shall reimburse Intergraph any defense expenses inclusive of reasonable attorneys’ fees expended by Intergraph in defense of said claim, and pay any judgment rendered against Intergraph. You shall make such defense by counsel of your choosing and Intergraph shall reasonably cooperate with said counsel at your sole cost and expense. You shall have sole control of said defense, but you shall allow Intergraph to reasonably participate in its own defense and you shall reasonably cooperate with Intergraph with respect to the settlement of any claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Intergraph may at any time decide to take over any defense of Intergraph at Intergraph’s cost and expense and you shall render full cooperation and assistance to transfer such defense to Intergraph and with respect to such defense.
