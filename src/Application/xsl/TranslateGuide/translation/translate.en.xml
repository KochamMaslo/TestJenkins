			<body>GeoMedia Â® SDI Portal is a web site application that acts as a client of SDI services.  It is installed and configured on a web application server for multiple users to access the site via a web browser.  It is used to view and query geospatial data published with standard SDI web services (e.g., OGC WMS, WFS, CSW) and integrate multiple sources into a single map view that can be easily navigated.</body>
